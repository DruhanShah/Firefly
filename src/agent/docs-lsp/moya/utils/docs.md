### LLMProviders Constants

#### Purpose
This code snippet defines constants for various Language Learning Model (LLM) providers within a single class, `LLMProviders`. This setup ensures that references to these providers are consistent and reduces the risk of typographical errors.

#### Functionality
The `LLMProviders` class contains three class-level constants:
- **OPENAI**: Represents the "openai" provider.
- **BEDROCK**: Represents the "bedrock" provider.
- **OLLAMA**: Represents the "ollama" provider.

These constants are used throughout the application to refer to the LLM providers in a consistent manner.

#### Key Components
- **LLMProviders Class**: A container for holding constants related to LLM providers.
  - `OPENAI`: "openai"
  - `BEDROCK`: "bedrock"
  - `OLLAMA`: "ollama"

#### Usage Example
Below is an example of how to use the constants defined in the `LLMProviders` class:

```python
# Import the LLMProviders class from the appropriate module
from module_containing_llm_providers import LLMProviders

# Print the constants
print(LLMProviders.OPENAI)  # Output: openai
print(LLMProviders.BEDROCK) # Output: bedrock
print(LLMProviders.OLLAMA)  # Output: ollama

# Use the constants in a logical condition
if selected_provider == LLMProviders.OPENAI:
    print("Using OpenAI as the provider.")
```

#### Rationale
Encapsulating the LLM provider constants within a class improves code organization and maintainability. This approach allows for easy updates or additions of new providers without affecting other areas of the codebase. It also promotes the use of predefined constants instead of hard-coded string values, which reduces errors and increases readability.

#### Additional Information
Using a class to hold related constants is a common pattern in Python and other programming languages. This pattern helps maintain a cleaner namespace and clarifies that the values are constants.
