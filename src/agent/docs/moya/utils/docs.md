# Documentation for Moya Utilities

This documentation covers the constants defined for LLM (Large Language Model) providers in the Moya project. The constants are used to maintain consistency and ease updates across the codebase.

---

## Overview

The code defines a single class, `LLMProviders`, which contains string constants representing different LLM providers. This helps in avoiding hard-coded strings throughout the codebase, thereby reducing errors and improving maintainability.

---

## File: constants.py

### Purpose

The file defines a set of constants for various LLM providers that can be used across the codebase. Using these constants ensures that references to LLM providers remain consistent.

### Key Components

- **LLMProviders Class:** 
  - A container class holding constants for various LLM providers.
  - **Class Variables:**
    - `OPENAI`: Represents the "openai" provider.
    - `BEDROCK`: Represents the "bedrock" provider.
    - `OLLAMA`: Represents the "ollama" provider.

### Functionality

The `LLMProviders` class works by initializing class variables with specific string values. These strings serve as identifiers for the respective LLM providers. By using class constants, any changes to the provider names need only be made in one location, influencing the entire codebase.

---

## Usage

To use the constants, simply refer to them via the class name. For example:

```python
# Accessing LLM provider constants
print(LLMProviders.OPENAI)   # Output: "openai"
print(LLMProviders.BEDROCK)   # Output: "bedrock"
print(LLMProviders.OLLAMA)    # Output: "ollama"
```

---

## Rationale

Utilizing constants for LLM providers provides the following benefits:
- **Maintainability:** Changes to provider names are centralized.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that the same terminology is used across the codebase.
- **Error Reduction:** Minimizes the risk of typos when using provider names in different parts of the code.

---

## Additional Information

- **Flexibility:** These constants allow for easy switching between LLM providers based on configuration settings or user input.
- **Simplicity:** The class is designed to be a simple container for constants without additional logic, making it easy to understand and use.

This approach ensures that the code is both maintainable and scalable, especially in environments where provider configurations might change over time.
