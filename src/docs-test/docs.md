# InMemoryRepository for Conversation Threads

## Purpose
The `InMemoryRepository` class is designed to manage conversation threads and their associated messages entirely in memory. It provides methods to create, retrieve, append to, list, and delete threads.

## Functionality
This class uses a Python dictionary to store threads. Each thread is associated with a unique thread ID, which acts as the dictionary key, and the value is a `Thread` object. Messages can be appended to these threads.

## Key Components
- **`InMemoryRepository` Class**
  - **`__init__`**: Initializes an empty dictionary to store threads.
  - **`create_thread(thread: Thread)`**: Adds a new thread to the dictionary. Raises a `ValueError` if a thread with the same ID already exists.
  - **`get_thread(thread_id: str)`**: Retrieves a thread based on its ID. Returns `None` if the thread is not found.
  - **`append_message(thread_id: str, message: Message)`**: Appends a message to an existing thread. Raises a `ValueError` if the thread does not exist.
  - **`list_threads()`**: Returns a list of all thread IDs.
  - **`delete_thread(thread_id: str)`**: Deletes a thread by its ID if it exists in the dictionary.

## Usage
Here are some examples of how to use the `InMemoryRepository` class:

```python
# Example usage

# Initialize the repository
repo = InMemoryRepository()

# Create threads
thread1 = Thread(thread_id="123")
repo.create_thread(thread1)

# Retrieve a thread
retrieved_thread = repo.get_thread("123")
print(retrieved_thread)

# Append a message to a thread
message1 = Message(content="Hello, World!")
repo.append_message("123", message1)

# List all thread IDs
print(repo.list_threads())

# Delete a thread
repo.delete_thread("123")
```

## Rationale
The in-memory repository is useful for scenarios where persistent storage is not required, like unit tests or temporary data caching. Using a dictionary allows for fast lookups, inserts, and deletions, making this implementation efficient for its intended purpose.

## Additional Information
- This implementation is limited to the memory available on the machine.
- All data is lost when the program terminates, as it is stored in RAM.
- It inherits from `BaseMemoryRepository`, providing a standardized interface for memory repository implementations.
