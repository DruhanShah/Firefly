# Documentation for src

This documentation provides an overview of the two primary components from the project: one for generating documentation (in __init__.py) and another for the documentation generator tool (in main.py).

---

## 1. Documentation for __init__.py

### Overview

This section describes two utility functions included in __init__.py that are used for automatic documentation and code solution generation:

- **`write_docs_for_directory`**: Automates the creation of documentation for a directory containing source files.
- **`generate_solution`**: Uses an AI code generation agent to produce code solutions based on problem descriptions.

---

### 1.1 Purpose

- **`write_docs_for_directory`**: Generates documentation for a given directory. It verifies the directory's existence, processes files, and outputs formatted documentation.
  
- **`generate_solution`**: Generates a code solution by initializing a `CodeGenerationAgent` with provided documentation and example files, then extracting relevant code segments from the generated output.

---

### 1.2 Functionality

#### Function: `write_docs_for_directory`
- **Actions Performed:**
  - Verifies the existence of the target directory.
  - Iterates through all files in the directory.
  - Creates an output directory and generates documentation files.
  - Supports multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java).
  - Aggregates the generated documentation into an index file.
  
- **Key Parameters:**
  - **directory**: The target directory containing source files.
  - **output_path**: The path where the generated documentation should be saved.

#### Function: `generate_solution`
- **Actions Performed:**
  - Initializes a `CodeGenerationAgent` with the provided documentation and example files.
  - Generates code based on the problem statement.
  - Extracts relevant code blocks from the agent's output ensuring the absence of markdown formatting.
  
- **Key Parameters:**
  - **problem_statement**: A textual description of the problem to solve.
  - **docs_paths**: A list of documentation file paths for reference.
  - **example_files**: A list of example files to provide additional context.

---

### 1.3 Usage Example

```python
# Example: Generating Documentation for a Directory
from your_package.main import write_docs_for_directory
from pathlib import Path

directory = Path('/path/to/source/code')
output = Path('/path/to/save/docs')
write_docs_for_directory(directory, output)

# Example: Generating a Solution for a Problem Statement
from your_package.agent.generate_code import generate_solution

problem_statement = "Write a function to reverse a string."
solution = generate_solution(problem_statement, ['docs/doc1.md'], ['examples/example1.py'])
print(solution)
```

---

### 1.4 Rationale

- **`write_docs_for_directory`**: Designed to streamline the process of documenting source files, facilitating easier maintenance and sharing.
- **`generate_solution`**: Leverages an AI-based approach to provide quick, relevant code solutions, thereby aiding rapid development and prototyping.

---

### 1.5 Additional Information

- The `write_docs_for_directory` function is versatile, supporting documentation generation for projects written in multiple programming languages.
- The `generate_solution` function ensures that code outputs are clean and free from markdown artifacts.

## 2. Documentation for main.py

### Overview

This section covers the Documentation Generator Tool implemented in main.py. The tool is capable of recursively generating Markdown documentation for code files in various programming languages and can operate on either a single file or an entire directory.

---

### 2.1 Purpose

The tool generates well-organized Markdown documentation for code files, creating an index for easy navigation. It processes an entire directory recursively or a single specified file by utilizing several utility functions.

---

### 2.2 Functionality

The tool processes files/directories and generates documentation by calling a series of functions:

#### Key Functions

1. **write_docs_for_directory(directory, output_path)**
   - Generates documentation for all files within the specified directory.
   - Manages directory traversal, documentation generation, and formatting.
   - Organizes the output into corresponding subdirectories.

2. **main()**
   - Serves as the entry point, parsing command-line arguments to determine the operating mode (file or directory).
   - Invokes the appropriate functions based on user inputs.

3. **parse_arguments()**
   - Parses and validates command-line arguments.
   - Returns an `argparse.Namespace` object containing user inputs.

4. **write_docs_for_file(file, dir_path=None, output_path=None, append=False)**
   - Generates documentation for a single file.
   - Supports appending to an existing documentation file if required.

5. **create_docs_index(base_dir, doc_files)**
   - Creates an index file providing links to all generated documentation files for quick navigation.

#### Key Variables

- **supported_lang_exts**: A list of file extensions that the tool supports for documentation.
- **all_doc_files**: Tracks all documentation files created during the process.
- **output_path**: Directory path where the generated documentation will be stored.

---

### 2.3 Usage

#### Command-Line Execution

```bash
# Example usage for a directory
python script.py -d /path/to/directory -o /path/to/output

# Example usage for a file
python script.py -f /path/to/file.py -o /path/to/output
```

#### Command-Line Arguments

- **-f, --file**: Path to a specific file for documentation generation.
- **-d, --directory**: Path to the directory for recursively generating documentation.
- **-o, --output**: Path where the generated documentation will be saved (defaults to the source directory if not provided).

---

### 2.4 Rationale

The design of this tool provides flexibility in documentation generation, including support for multiple languages and recursive processing of directories. It creates an organized structure along with a central index file, ensuring quick access to generated documentation.

---

### 2.5 Additional Information

- Functions like `generate_documentation` and `format_docs_file` (imported from external modules) handle the core logic of content generation and formatting.
- Placeholders such as `setup_lsp_server` and `get_code` indicate future integration with language server protocol functionality.
- The tool explicitly skips unsupported file types, ensuring that only relevant files are processed.
- Ensure that all required external modules and dependencies are installed for proper functionality.
